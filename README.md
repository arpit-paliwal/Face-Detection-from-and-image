# Face-Detection-from-an-image Using Open cv (C++)
This project is about facedetection from and image using haarcascade algorithm
there are various algorithms available for face detection but the haarcascade has been the most accurate one for long time the only drawback with this algorithm is that it can detect frontal faces only. 
for more detailed knowledge you can visit Open CV official website and read its official documentation.
